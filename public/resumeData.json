    "bio":"I am a recent coding bootcamp graduate that currently lives in Birmingham, AL with my wife Tamara and our golden retriever Jax. I spent several years in the military before I decided to go to college and pursue other opportunities. After graduation from college I worked in my field of study but realized I did not enjoy it. I was exposed to coding and web development while searching for the next opportunity in my professional career. I took the opportunity to take a coding bootcamp and am now pursuing the opportunities to do something I enjoy doing.",
